## 0.0.1-alpha6
Switched to better method to block token and lights for shadows. Fixes the visual artifacts. Shadows for a token given unlimited lighting are very faint, which might be fine but would probably prefer a bit more darkness.

All three parts of lighting are blocked fully. Would prefer something with an alpha gradient to blend the lighting shadows.

## 0.0.1-alpha5
Working prototype for token vision and lights. Corrections to the calculation of the shadow polygons and better use of Clipper to union shadows for a given source.

When viewing the vision from a token, areas are shaded if partially obscured by a wall lower than the token. Other tokens elevated above the wall can be seen. Some visual artifacts when moving tokens around but not too bad.

Lights currently add shadows at the lighting layer level, which is not ideal but works for now. Future work needed to mask individual lights properly.

## 0.0.1-alpha4
Working prototype for ambient light sources. When the wall height is less than the light source elevation, one or more shadow polygons are constructed representing how the light is obscured by the wall. For now, shadows are just drawn on the canvas.

## 0.0.1-alpha3
Change the module name. Starting anew on the code.

## 0.0.1-alpha2
Wrap testVisibility in order to hide a token based on elevation.
Given one or more points of vision to a token:
- test for intersection with an Enhanced Terrain Layer polygon.
- Test if the token can be seen from the point(s) of vision, assuming 3-D elevation for the token, wall, and point(s) of vision.
- Hide token as necessary

Also adds a log debug flag using the devMode module, and currently sets a debug flag to visualize the terrain polygons and intersections.

## 0.0.1-alpha1
Basic framework
